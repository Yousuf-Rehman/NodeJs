# NodeLinuxTerminal

- You have to run the first.js file

```bash

node first.js
```

- You may enter commands like ls, cd, mkdir etc except sudo, vi, vim etc. Why not all? The reason is these commands either required password, or open the something in terminal and I am handling just the command output on console. You may think that **cd** command also change the flow its not simply output, yes! I have handled it seperately. You can handle bunch of commands seperately If you wanted to.
